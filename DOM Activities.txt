DOM (Document Object Model) is a powerful API that allows developers to manipulate and interact with HTML, XML, and SVG documents. Here are some common activities that can be performed using DOM:

Accessing and modifying elements: With DOM, you can easily access and modify elements in an HTML document. You can change the text content, attributes, and styles of elements, as well as add or remove elements from the DOM tree.

Traversing the DOM tree: You can traverse the DOM tree to navigate through the hierarchy of elements in the document. You can access the parent, child, and sibling elements of any given element.

Creating new elements: You can create new elements using DOM and add them to the document. This allows you to dynamically generate content based on user input or other factors.

Responding to events: You can use DOM event listeners to respond to user interactions with the document, such as clicks, scrolls, and key presses.

Validating input: You can use DOM to validate user input in forms, such as ensuring that required fields are filled in and that the format of data is correct.

Animating elements: You can use DOM to create animations by changing the position, size, and opacity of elements over time.

These are just some of the activities that can be performed using DOM. With its extensive functionality and flexibility, there are countless ways to use DOM to enhance and customize web applications.
